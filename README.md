# eBird Hotspot Viewer

A simple app to view recent observations at nearby [eBird](http://ebird.org/) [hotspots](http://ebird.org/ebird/hotspots).

This application was developed as part of an R+D project at [Azavea](http://www.azavea.com) primarily to work with [eBird data](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/CLOISAPI/eBird+API+1.1), but also to learn more about React, Flux architecture, ES2015, and Webpack. It was designed with mobile-access in mind.
